Creating a chatbot for preliminary health assessments involves crafting questions that can effectively gather necessary information without being invasive or offering direct medical advice. The questions should be designed to guide users in understanding when to seek professional medical help. Here are some stages and examples of questions that such a chatbot might ask:
# 1. Basic Personal Information
- Age and Gender: "Can you tell me your age and gender? This information helps in making more accurate assessments."
- Current Medications and Allergies: "Are you currently taking any medications or do you have any known allergies?"

# 2. Primary Complaint or Symptom
- Symptom Identification: "What specific symptoms are you experiencing?"
- Onset of Symptoms: "When did these symptoms start?"
- Severity and Nature: "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your discomfort or pain? Is it constant or does it come and go?"

# 3. Health History
- Past Medical History: "Have you had any previous health issues or surgeries?"
- Family Health History: "Is there any family history of major illnesses that you're aware of?"

# 4. Lifestyle Factors
- Lifestyle Questions: "Can you briefly describe your lifestyle habits, such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns?"
- Stress and Mental Health: "Have you been experiencing any stress or changes in your mental health recently?"

# 5. Environmental and Occupational Factors
- Environmental Exposure: "Have you been exposed to anything unusual in your environment recently?"
- Occupational Hazards: "Does your occupation expose you to any health risks?"
